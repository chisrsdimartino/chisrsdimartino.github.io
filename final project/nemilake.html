      <div class="text"> Lake Nemi, also called Diana's Mirror, is a small circular volcanic lake, taking its name from Nemi, the largest town in the area.The lake is famous for its sunken Roman ships. These ships were very large and technologically advanced for their time.
        The lake was sacred to the goddess Diana Nemorensis and the site of the festival Nemoralia. Near the sanctuary of Diana were found a number of diminutive bronze statues of draped women and men, each holding libation bowls and incense boxes.  </div>
